*COMMON keyword: this needs to be the first keyword and is mandatory. 
	(1) reference density
    (2) Young's modulus
    (3) Poisson ratio
    (4) linear viscosity coefficient
    (5) quadratic viscosity coefficient
    (6) hourglass control coefficient
    (7) heat capacity [energy / (mass * temperature)]
    
    from the above quantities, the following parameters are calculated
    (A) Lame constants lambda
    (B) shear modulus
    (C) signal velocity
    
MATERIAL MODELS
===============

Linear elasticity model with no separation of pressure and stress deviator.
keyword: *LINEAR_DEFGRAD
number of trailing parameters: 0
This material model is based on the deformation gradient only and performs no time integration of the stress rate.
Material properties are derived from *COMMON parameters.

MATERIAL STRENGTH MODELS
========================

keyword: *LINEAR
number of trailing parameters: 0
description: This material model is linear elastic.

keyword: *LINEAR_PLASTIC
number of trailing parameters: 1
	(1) constant yield stress
description: This material model is linear elastic -- perfectly plastic.
