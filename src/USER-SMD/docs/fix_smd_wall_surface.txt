fix smd/wall_surface command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID smd/wall_surface arg type mol-ID :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
smd/wall_surface = style name of this fix command :l
arg = {file} :l
   {file} = file name of a triangular mesh in stl format :pre
type = particle type to be given to the particles of the generated lattice :l
mod-ID = molecule-ID which has to be bigger than :l
       
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all smd/wall_surface geometry.stl 2 65535
fix stl_surf all smd/wall_surface tool.stl 2 65535 :pre

[Description:]

This fix creates a lattice of particles using an stl-file of a triangulated mesh. A particle
will be placed at the center of every trianlular element of the mesh. The vertices of every
triangle will be also stored together with the corresponding particle.   

See "this PDF guide"_USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization. This fix has no outputs.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.
