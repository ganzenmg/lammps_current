fix smd/move_tri_surf command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID smd/move_tri_surf keyword :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
smd/move_tri_surf keyword = style name of this fix command :l
keyword = {*LINEAR} or {*WIGGLE} or {*ROTATE} :l

   {*LINEAR} args = Vx Vy Vz
      Vx,Vy,Vz = components of velocity vector (velocity units), any component can be specified as NULL
   {*WIGGLE} args = Vx Vy Vz max_travel
      vx,vy,vz = components of velocity vector (velocity units), any component can be specified as NULL
      max_travel = amplitud???
   {*ROTATE} args = Px Py Pz Rx Ry Rz period
      Px,Py,Pz = origin point of axis of rotation (distance units)
      Rx,Ry,Rz = axis of rotation vector
      period = period of rotation (time units) :pre
      
one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
:ule      

[Examples:]

tool_fix tool smd/move_tri_surf *LINEAR 20 20 10
tool_fix tool smd/move_tri_surf *WIGGLE 20 20 10
tool_fix tool smd/move_tri_surf *ROTATE 0 0 0 5 2 1 :pre

[Description:]

This fix Perform updates of position and velocity for atoms in
the group each timestep using the specified settings or formulas,
without regard to forces on the atoms. This can be useful for
implemanting Dirichlet Boundary Conditions (DBC).

The {*LINEAR} style moves atoms with the specified constant velocity
vector V = (Vx,Vy,Vz). This style also sets the velocity of each atom
to V = (Vx,Vy,Vz). 

The {*WIGGLE} style moves atoms in an oscillatory fashion.
Particles are moved along (vx, vy, vz) with constant velocity until a
displacement of max_travel is reached. Then, the velocity vector is
reversed. This process is repeated.

The {*ROTATE} style rotates particles around a rotation axis R = (Rx,Ry,Rz) that
goes through a point P = (Px,Py,Pz). The period of the rotation is also
specified. This style also sets the velocity of each atom to (omega cross
Rperp) where omega is its angular velocity around the rotation axis and
Rperp is a perpendicular vector from the rotation axis to the atom.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization. This fix has no outputs.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info
