compute smd/damage command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/damage :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/damage = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/damage :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the damage of the per-pair
interaction. The failure model is based on the plastic strain. If
the interacting particles exceed the plastic failure strain, a
degradation (damage) ocurres based on the evolution of the plastic
strain. This applies only for particles under tension mode, which
means that the particles move away of each other.

See "this PDF guide"_USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output Info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.  See
"How-to discussions, section 6.15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle values will be given dimensionless. See "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.
