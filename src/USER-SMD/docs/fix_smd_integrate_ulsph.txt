fix smd/integrate_ulsph command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID smd/integrate_ulsph keyword :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
smd/integrate_ulsph = style name of this fix command
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended

keyword = xsph or adjust_radius or limit_velocity

xsph
adjust_radius values = adjust_radius_factor min_nn max_nn
      adjust_radius_factor = factor which scale the smooth/kernel radius
      min_nn = minimum number of neighbors
      max_nn = maximum number of neighbors
limit_velocity values = max_velocity
      max_velocity = maximum allowed velocity.  
   

Note to self: remove updte / reinit keywords from this fix.

[Examples:]

fix 1 all smd/integrate_ulsph adjust_radius 0.5 25 50 :pre
fix 1 all smd/integrate_ulsph xsph limit_velocity 1000 :pre

[Description:]

The fix sets the method for the time integration as updated-lagrange SPH.
See "this PDF guide"_USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

The {xsph} keyword activates Monaghan's XSPH time integration approach, where a particle is moved according to the average velocity within its neighborhood.
If the xsph keyword is absent, the usual Velocity-Verlet time intergration approach is employed.  

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization. This fix has no outputs.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.

[Default:] none
