compute smd/internal_energy command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/internal_energy :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/smd/internal_energy = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/internal_energy :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the individual internal energy,
which is defined as the sum of the potential energy and the heat, this
quantity is also defined as Entalpy.

See "this PDF guide"_USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output Info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
"How-to discussions, section 6.15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-atom vector values will be given in "units"_units.html of energy.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.
