fix smd/integrate_tlsph command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID smd/integrate_tlsph keyword values :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
smd/integrate_tlsph = style name of this fix command :l
keyword = {xsph} or {limit_velocity}  :l

  {limit_velocity} value = max_vel
    max_vel = maximum allowed velocity :pre

zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l

:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all smd/integrate_tlsph xsph
fix 1 all smd/integrate_tlsph xsph limit_velocity 1000 :pre

[Description:]

The fix sets the method for the time integration as total-lagrange SPH.  

See "this PDF guide"_USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

The {xsph} keyword activates Monaghan's XSPH time integration approach,
where a particle is moved according to the average velocity within its
neighborhood. If the xsph keyword is absent, the usual Velocity-Verlet
time intergration approach is employed.

The {limit_velocity} keyword will control the velocity, scaling the norm of
the velocity vector to max_vel in case it exceeds this velocity limit. 

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization. This fix has no outputs.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.
